Apache Kafka
The task is to implement a system for creating online orders for pizzeria "Palmetto".
The architecture of the“Palmetto” online ordering platform
The online ordering system consists of the following components:
● There are 3 Spring Boot applications (“Client App”, “Palmetto App”, “Courier App”).
“Client App” has a database for storing order information. You can use any preferred
database;
● Apache Kafka is a message broker. It has 2 topics. The Order topic is used for
sending events with customer orders to the pizzeria. The Notification topic is used for
sending events with a new order status.
The Client App is a service for receiving and storing incoming orders from clients. It has a
REST API with two endpoints. The first endpoint is used for receiving an order from a
customer. The second endpoint is used for getting information about the order. The Client
App is subscribed to the Notification topic for receiving messages with a new order status.
The Palmetto App is a pizzeria service for preparing customer orders. It is subscribed to the
Order topic for receiving orders from the Client App and sends a new order status to the
Notification topic.
The Courier App is a courier service that facilitates order delivery to customers. It is
subscribed to the Notification topic for receiving orders from the Palmetto App and it sends a
new order status to the Notification topic.
Process diagram
Non-functional requirements:
● each service has 3 consumers, one for each partition,
● use a correlation ID to distinguish orders,
● use “At least once” delivery semantic for each consumer and producer with Acks=1,
● each topic should consist of 3 partitions.
*Extra mile.
Create integration tests using Kafka test containers.
